<h1>Don't Stop the Music</h1>
Recommender system has many successful applications in the industry. According to statistics, 40% of Amazon's sales are generated by the recommender system. In this project, we will build a music recommender system using Spark and data science libraries. This system will abstract the users' music history and other related data, then to analyze the potential preference similarity between different users, and provide favorite music for them more accurately. In detail, Hadoop HDFS is usually used for data storage, and spark, MapReduce and other distributed computing engines are used for feature extraction, calculation and data management.

we're considering two datasets.
One is WSDM_KKBOX(https://www.kaggle.com/bvmadduluri/wsdm-kkbox), which contains 6 data files, which are song_extra_info.csv(2295971 rows),   songs.csv(2296320 rows), train.csv(7377418 rows), test.csv(2556790 rows).
The other one is Million Song Dataset(http://millionsongdataset.com/), which also contains songs data and user data. The whole dataset is 280GB, but it also offers a much smaller subset.
