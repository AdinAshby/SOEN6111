<h1>Don't Stop the Music</h1>
<h2> Introduction </h2>
 The recommender system has many successful applications in the industry. According to statistics, 40% of Amazon's sales are generated by the recommender system; 75% of Netflix users use the recommendation system to find their favorite videos; 30% of Netflix users use keywords to search the products they need before online shopping. At present, almost all news, search, advertising, short video applications are based on the recommender system.
<br>Our study is based on Million Song Dataset Challenge posted in Kaggle in 2012, aiming to make efficient offline music recommendations for users.   In this project, we plan to set up a music recommender system. Specifically, a system recommends music that the listeners would like to hear no matter they heard before or not.  Our objectives include 1) Data processing: The data is processed in the offline layer, i.e., using spark and other computing engines for data analysis and feature extraction. 2) Algorithms implementation: We will use the Nearest neighborhood model(user-based and item-based model individually) and Collaborative filtering algorithms as the primary algorithms to predict (filter) users' tastes by learning the historical data(collaboration). 3) Improvement: mix these two models or research on other algorithms(like user-user based and item-item based collaborative filtering ) will be considered to minimize the error between predicted ratings and actual ratings.  
<br>We consider the following factors as a checklist while conducting the project (problems to solve):
Data cleaning. For example, some NaN data and obvious incorrect data should be removed. Those who listened to a variety of music without specific taste should be opt-out.
Model calculation. The similarity of the two users should be calculated thus to make the comparison.
Improve the prediction. We would love to make a combination of User-based and Item-based models to improve the prediction by the single model. How to effectively combine these two is a problem we have not considered.
