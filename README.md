<h1>Don't Stop the Music</h1>
Recommender system has many successful applications in the industry. According to statistics, 40% of Amazon's sales are generated by the recommender system. In this project, we will build a music recommender system using Spark and data science libraries. This system will abstract the users' music history and other related data, then to analyze the potential preference similarity between different users, and provide favorite music for them more accurately. In detail, Hadoop HDFS is usually used for data storage, and spark, MapReduce and other distributed computing engines are used for feature extraction, calculation and data management.
